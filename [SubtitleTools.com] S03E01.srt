JUJUTSU KAISEN
The Culling Game Part 1

6
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,660
So, is Mai-chan dead?

7
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,340
It's the clan head you
should be concerned about.

8
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,810
Besides, the one who's nearly dead is Maki.

9
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,780
That so? Good thing, that.

10
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,580
Maki-chan's a real beauty, but she's no good.

11
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,770
She can't support a man.

12
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,760
Any woman who can't walk
humbly behind her man

13
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,020
deserves to be stabbed
in the back and killed.

14
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,670
Mai-chan's a great woman in that regard.

15
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,820
Special First-Grade Sorcerer    Naoya Zen'in

16
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,650
She has the same face and
the same tits as Maki-chan.

17
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,470
She may put on a brave face,

18
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,700
but she understands her place as a woman.

19
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,840
You're late.

20
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,970
What were you doing?

21
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,500
Your own father is in critical condition!

22
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,060
Sorry.

23
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,110
But what's it matter if I'm here or not?

24
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm gonna be the next head
of the Zen'in Clan anyway.

25
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,090
All my older brothers are knuckleheads.

26
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,440
And Uncle,

27
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,110
you're his little brother,
but you're lackluster.

28
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,440
Your daughters are out of the question.

29
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,430
And Jinichi-kun, well...

30
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,930
Your looks are no good.

31
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,770
Woulda been better if you
got Toji-kun's looks.

32
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,870
Special First-Grade Sorcerer    Ogi Zen'in

33
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,080
Special First-Grade Sorcerer    Jinichi Zen'in

34
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,090
Papa's in critical condition, y'know?

35
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,910
Cut me some slack.

36
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,960
I see everyone's here.

37
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,060
Just now, the head of the Zen'in Clan,

38
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,570
Naobito Zen'in-sama, has passed away.

39
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,150
I, Furudate, shall now read his will,
which he entrusted to me.

40
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,820
It was Naobito-sama's wish that
this will be read by me once

41
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,020
Ogi Zen'in-sama,

42
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,690
Jinichi Zen'in-sama,

43
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,990
and Naoya Zen'in-sama

44
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,630
were all gathered together.

45
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,010
If there are no objections,
then I shall begin the reading of his will.

46
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,510
First, Naoya Zen'in shall be made
the 27th head of the Zen'in Clan.

47
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,340
Second, Naoya shall inherit all
the assets and cursed tools stored

48
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,520
in both the Jujutsu High and
the Zen'in Clan's forbidden vaults,

49
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,690
and Naoya shall require agreement
from either Ogi Zen'in or Jinichi Zen'in

50
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,350
to make use of their contents.

51
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,350
Tsk.

52
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,600
Well, that's fine.

53
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,410
However,

54
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,700
in the event that Satoru Gojo has died,

55
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,420
or otherwise lost the use of his
mental faculties for any reason,

56
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,120
then the covenant with
Toji Fushiguro shall be fulfilled.

57
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,270
Megumi Fushiguro shall be
welcomed into the Zen'in Clan,

58
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,430
and that same person shall
become the head of the Zen'in Clan,

59
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,690
inheriting all of its assets.

60
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,560
Huh?!

61
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,470
This ain't good.

62
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,470
Those two have no balls.

63
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,760
They think having some
unknown brat as the head

64
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,940
would be better than me,
so they ain't doing jack.

65
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,330
Where's Megumi-kun, and
what's he doing right now?

66
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,990
I don't know much...

67
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,830
Only that he's on a mission
to find Yuji Itadori in Tokyo.

68
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,040
Who's that?

69
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,210
The vessel of Sukuna.

70
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,920
Then go tell the big shots

71
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,950
that Naoya Zen'in is gonna
kill Sukuna's vessel.

72
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,260
Megumi-kun is with Sukuna's vessel, yeah?

73
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,590
I'll kill 'em both together.

74
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,470
Tokyo is pandemonium right now.

75
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,850
People can die anytime for any reason there.

76
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,000
Once I kill him, the rest
will work itself out.

77
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,530
I'm the head of the Zen'in Clan!

78
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,650
Die!

79
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,420
Kugisaki!

80
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,420
Only me!

81
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,850
You take it from here.

82
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,850
Die!

83
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,110
Itadori.

84
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,510
Itadori-kun.

85
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,540
What will you do?

86
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,570
Yuji.

87
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,910
How are your injuries?

88
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,600
They're fine, other than where
I took that Black Flash.

89
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,250
It's probably because of Sukuna.

90
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
I can feel how his power has grown stronger.

91
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,030
Yuji.

92
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,930
Don't worry about me.

93
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,910
You can return to Jujutsu High, you know.

94
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,800
I'd like to retrieve the remains
of Shoso and the others, too.

95
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,710
I'm not worried.

96
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,840
It's not even an issue of
me wanting to return or not.

97
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,730
Sukuna is plotting something
that uses Fushiguro.

98
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,260
Plus, I've killed so many people.

99
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,810
What are you going to do when someone
you saved kills someone else in the future?

100
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,100
I can't stay with the others anymore.

101
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,770
And are you okay with this, Choso?

102
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,060
I killed your little brothers, too.

103
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,020
It's fine.

104
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,590
That was an accident.

105
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,700
Eso and Kechizu would have
done the same in my position.

106
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,190
Forgiving you or not doesn't matter.

107
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,750
That's what it means to be siblings.

108
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,160
Let's go.

109
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,970
For now, we need to reduce
the number of cursed spirits.

110
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,580
Choso!

111
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,830
Yuji.

112
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,870
How terrifying.

113
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,530
I already sensed he was
powerful when we fought.

114
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,450
Now he's added subtlety to it.

115
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,310
He has unfaltering control
of his cursed energy

116
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,360
and exceptional physical strength.

117
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
He's truly like a war god!

118
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,910
That shows he wasn't yet
in top shape until now.

119
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,130
You're impressive, my little brother.

120
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,970
You're still saying that?

121
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,830
I'll say it as often as it takes.

122
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,970
Remember back.

123
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,630
They should have been there.

124
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,390
Your father should have had
stitches in his forehead, too.

125
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,630
Megumi-kun ain't here?

126
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,520
Am I the first to arrive?

127
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,700
Is that really possible?

128
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,740
He's way too slow.

129
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,150
Who's this guy?

130
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,490
Was he just talking about Fushiguro?

131
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,520
What are y'all doing, anyway?

132
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,010
You're sticking out too much.

133
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,390
Not gonna try to escape?

134
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,170
Escape?

135
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,860
What, you don't know?

136
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,030
You've been sentenced to death.

137
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,380
You lost Satoru-kun's protection, after all.

138
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Huh?!

139
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,670
There are many sorcerers who've been saved

140
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,470
due to Gojo-san's influence,
pride, and whims.

141
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,030
My business is with Megumi-kun,

142
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,150
so to be blunt, I couldn't
care less if you live or die.

143
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,350
Don't want you running
around willy-nilly, though,

144
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,110
so I'm gonna break your legs for now.

145
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,510
What do you want with Fushiguro?

146
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,010
I need him to die.

147
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,440
Though it'd be great for me if he'd
write a few lines before he goes.

148
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,370
I heard Megumi-kun's been searching for you.

149
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,640
He's certainly fast, but something's off.

150
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,650
It's probably his technique.

151
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,020
You're doing better than I expected.

152
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,030
I honestly underestimated you.

153
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,980
I know the vessel's got stuff going on,

154
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,520
but what's that thing beside him?

155
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,360
Guess I'll crank the speed up a bit more.

156
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,080
Gojo-sensei?! No!

157
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,990
It's even creepier!

158
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,930
Huh? You're not alone.

159
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

160
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,550
Who are you?

161
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,810
Whoever he is, his goal is...

162
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,810
What are each of you to Itadori-kun?

163
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,570
So you are here to execute Yuji.

164
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,200
Hold up. I'm on your side.

165
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,580
You're Okkotsu-kun, yeah?

166
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,140
Okkotsu!

167
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,300
The second-year Fushiguro mentioned!

168
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,580
A special-grade sorcerer, like Gojo-sensei!

169
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,830
And you are?

170
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,340
I'm Naoya Zen'in.

171
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm Maki-chan's cousin,

172
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,160
and I've been told to kill
Itadori-kun, like you were.

173
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,130
We're running, Yuji.

174
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,840
So relax.

175
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,220
I'll stay outta your way.

176
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,940
The blond one's a speed type
with some kind of trick.

177
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,100
We need to avoid getting into a chase.

178
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,980
I'll stall him.

179
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,350
Will you be okay?

180
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,170
In return, once you've killed Itadori-kun,

181
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,140
could you hold off on reporting it for a bit?

182
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,370
I want to use him as bait
so I can see someone.

183
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,060
I will be.

184
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,650
You're the one they're after, Yuji.

185
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,320
That black-haired one...

186
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,800
Okkotsu. Just worry about
getting away from him.

187
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,720
He seems like the same type as Satoru Gojo.

188
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,500
You'll die if you fight him.

189
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,430
I shoulda kept quiet about Megumi-kun.

190
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,750
That gave me shivers.

191
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,260
It's a plan that keeps Yuji
from fighting another human

192
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,200
and prevents him from
feeling guilty toward me.

193
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,310
He's such a handful.

194
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,390
We'll meet up at yesterday's spot!

195
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,670
Fine by me.

196
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,520
I'll leave that one to you, then.

197
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,330
Yeah!

198
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,870
He's fast!

199
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,770
He's this fast with a drawn sword?!

200
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
He's fast.

201
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,030
I'd planned to crush him
when he broke into a run.

202
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,010
Tsk!

203
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,620
I was trying to block Okkotsu's path,
but he read my intentions!

204
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,770
I was watching earlier.

205
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,080
That's Blood Manipulation, isn't it?

206
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,270
I don't know why you have it, though.

207
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,030
Still, it's not that scary,
aside from Piercing Blood.

208
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,870
And producing Piercing
Blood takes Convergence.

209
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,340
There's a long build-up.

210
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,560
I don't need to say any more, do I?

211
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,090
It's checkmate. You're gonna die.

212
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,040
You're the one who'll die.

213
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,260
Did you think you could
go after my little brother

214
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,080
and leave here alive?

215
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm sure I cut him, too.

216
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,610
He's like Maki-san.

217
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,630
Surprised?

218
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,280
I don't seem like the power type, do I?

219
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Even without raw power,

220
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,750
he has an insane amount of cursed energy!

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,910
I actually am on the weaker side.

222
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,070
He's enhancing himself with cursed
energy to cover for his lack of power.

223
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,250
Everyone does that to some degree,
but when he does it...

224
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,910
The exact opposite of me, then.

225
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,170
Have you noticed?

226
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,190
I have even more cursed
energy than Gojo-sensei.

227
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,200
But Sensei has his Six Eyes,

228
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,890
so he wastes practically no energy

229
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,790
when activating his technique.

230
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,770
He's the best there is when
it comes to performance.

231
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,120
I can run out of cursed energy,

232
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,710
but Sensei can't.

233
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,750
Enough chatting.

234
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,190
Shit!

235
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,800
The better the sorcerer,

236
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,180
the harder it is to read the
flow of their cursed energy.

237
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,170
For a different reason from why yours is.

238
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,660
Third-rate

239
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,670
When a sorcerer is inexperienced with manipulating cursed energy, there's a deviation in the
cursed energy during their preliminary movements, allowing the prediction of their next action.

240
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,760
That's because the better a sorcerer is,

241
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,680
the more precisely they
manipulate cursed energy.

242
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,920
When they have mastered manipulating cursed energy, there is no such deviation in their cursed energy, making it difficult to predict their action until the last second.

243
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,920
First-rate

244
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,920
That means you can't predict
their attack until the last second.

245
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,180
But with this guy...

246
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,430
There's cursed energy constantly rising
from his entire body, even his sword!

247
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,080
It's not even a question
of reading his movements!

248
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,180
All of his attacks can
prove to be decisive blows,

249
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,440
and he can reduce all damage
to the bare minimum!

250
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,190
You take it from here.

251
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,690
Sorry, but I can't afford to die yet!

252
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,740
There are some types

253
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,540
who center their training
around the use of a weapon,

254
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,480
but you don't want to become
dependent on a cursed tool

255
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,380
and neglect your manipulation
of cursed energy.

256
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,880
That's still a ways off for you, though.

257
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,260
So Slaughter Demon's just
an emergency measure.

258
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,760
You never taught me that!

259
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,100
You're putting too much focus into the blade.

260
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
It broke?

261
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,900
Well, of course it would.

262
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,860
He's one of Gojo-sensei's students.

263
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,130
I guess you won't go down easily.

264
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,780
The wound's deep!

265
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,490
But none of my organs are falling out!

266
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,050
And now we're both unarmed!

267
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,130
I can win this!

268
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,740
What are you doing?

269
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,660
We're just playing, Rika-chan.

270
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,830
"Rika"?! What is this thing?!

271
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,970
A shikigami?!

272
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,640
Where did it come from?!

273
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,520
Hold him still.

274
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,270
I can't move!

275
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,520
What power!

276
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm sorry,

277
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,460
Itadori-kun.

278
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,950
Older brothers who are less competent
than a younger brother serve no purpose.

279
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,610
...I can't understand how you
could never love your brothers.

280
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,740
...please report Itadori-kun's death...

281
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,440
...all of the distortions may
have started back then.

282
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,450
Don't look down on me!

283
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,410
So start by saving me...

284
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,070
It's checkmate.

285
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,020
Next Episode
One More Time

286
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,580
Tsumiki has been drawn into this game, too.
