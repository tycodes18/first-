The Culling Game Part 1

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,890
Episode 49
One More Time

4
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,510
I'm sorry,

5
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,450
Itadori-kun.

6
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,520
Tsk.

7
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,170
He's fast!

8
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,600
I can't figure out the
trick to his technique!

9
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,980
With him overwhelming
me this badly already,

10
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,230
he's not likely to reveal his hand, either.

11
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,060
I have no chance to use Convergence!

12
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,770
None of my external Blood
Manipulation is usable here!

13
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,960
You're persistent.

14
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,870
Seriously, what are you?

15
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,660
An older brother.

16
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,160
To nine other siblings.

17
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,550
Flowing Red Scale - Stack!

18
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,550
Flowing Red Scale - Stack

19
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,040
That ain't an answer.

20
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,260
I was asking about

21
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,800
your toughness and that technique...

22
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
He's starting to match me.

23
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,150
I see.

24
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,150
Flowing Red Scale, huh?

25
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,960
He's focusing that power
on his external eye muscles

26
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,170
to improve his kinetic vision.

27
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,330
Too bad.

28
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm setting motions on the
assumption of a counter.

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,510
You're persistent, so I
went ahead and used it.

30
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,390
My weapon.

31
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,120
You've got Blood Manipulation,

32
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,050
so staunching blood flow
should be your forte.

33
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,420
Let's find out how well you fare against me

34
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,070
while distracted with
staunching your bleeding.

35
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,690
You came well prepared.

36
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,250
Keep it a secret.

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,330
Honestly, I think it's lame.

38
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,630
A sorcerer walking around with a weapon?

39
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,390
Feels strange if you can't win without it.

40
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,700
A surprising number of
people share this idea.

41
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,020
My own older brothers are pathetic,
carrying them around.

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,710
Yet they think they have any right
to complain about Toji-kun.

43
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,670
You hate them, don't you? Your brothers?

44
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,100
I do.

45
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,760
Older brothers who are less competent
than a younger brother serve no purpose.

46
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,130
They deserve to be hung.

47
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,550
You might be who you are now

48
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,270
thanks to those older brothers.

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,500
Huh?

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,240
Did you just say something super disgusting?

51
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm grossed out.

52
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,410
Competent or not, older brothers

53
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,790
serve as an example to their younger brother.

54
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
If I go down the wrong path,

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,650
then my little brothers
can just avoid that path.

56
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,220
And if I go down the proper path,

57
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,600
then my little brothers can follow after me.

58
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,610
What would you do

59
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,690
if you were strong because your
older brothers proved weak?

60
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,420
You asked me why I'm so tough?

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,460
I'll tell you.

62
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,320
I never had an example.

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,620
I had to make many, many, many mistakes.

64
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,760
Yet I always had to keep
walking in front of my brothers.

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,030
That's why I'm strong!

66
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,960
What's he on about?

67
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,200
How's he still alive after bleeding so much?

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,790
The Death Paintings are
a mix of curse and human.

69
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,060
They possess the unique ability to
convert cursed energy into blood.

70
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,030
Until their cursed energy dries up,
they cannot die from blood loss.

71
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,650
My legs are heavy?!

72
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,170
Did he harden the blood that
seeped into the fabric?!

73
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,540
You get it, right?

74
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,170
It's checkmate.

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,410
I'm not sure about that.

76
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,160
My technique traces the motions

77
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
set ahead of time at 24 fps.

78
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,770
I can still move without issue
under this minor a hindrance.

79
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,670
Let's try it.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,900
Why isn't he firing at me?

81
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
This was Choso's original,

82
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,670
developed after grappling with
his technique for 150 years.

83
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,660
Supernova

84
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,500
Sorry, but I can't understand how
you could never love your brothers.

85
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,220
That looks painful,

86
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,470
Naoya-san.

87
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,450
Don't look down on me!

88
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,230
What's this?

89
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,170
Poison?

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,690
Blood Manipulation shouldn't be capable of—

91
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,670
No! It's not a product of his technique!

92
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,460
He had that much blood
because he's not human!

93
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,100
An incarnation?!

94
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,690
His inhuman blood got into my
body and is being rejected!

95
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,460
Shall I heal you?

96
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,240
My reverse cursed technique
can heal people, too.

97
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,040
In return,

98
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,900
could you please report Itadori-kun's death

99
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,990
to the top brass, as well?

100
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,750
Jin!

101
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,930
What is it, Dad?

102
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,180
If you want to talk about
her, I'm going home.

103
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,040
Jin!

104
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,470
You're free to live your
life however you please.

105
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,640
But you have to stay away from that woman!

106
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,540
You'll die!

107
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,340
Please stop saying such mean
things in front of Yuji.

108
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,610
You'd be surprised at how
much a baby can remember.

109
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,800
I know that you've wanted a child,

110
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,490
and I know you were never
able to do that with Kaori.

111
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,290
But Kaori died—

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,500
Father, what are you talking about?

113
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,880
Huh? I'm...

114
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,330
Th-Thank goodness!

115
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,080
Huh?

116
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,470
Around September, I think?

117
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,600
Gojo-sensei went out of his way to see me.

118
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,610
He asked me to take care of you.

119
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,240
So I had no choice but to put on that act.

120
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
Act?

121
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,500
I've got a bit of a bad feeling,

122
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,270
so if anything happens to me,

123
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,580
I want you to take care of the
first- and second-years, Yuta.

124
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,780
Hakari? Well, he'll be fine.

125
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,810
If anything happens?

126
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,260
Troubles with women?

127
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,160
You've learned to joke
around, haven't you, Yuta?

128
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,500
No, I just can't imagine anything
happening to you, Gojo-sensei.

129
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,210
Take special care of Yuji Itadori.

130
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,020
He's been sentenced to

131
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,500
secret execution, like you were.

132
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,240
It'd be a big help if you looked out for him.

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,510
Oh, how's Miguel?

134
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,810
He said he didn't want to see you.

135
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,930
Oh.

136
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,580
I decided that putting on
this act was the best option

137
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,170
to prevent someone else from
being sent to execute you

138
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,900
and having information about you cut off.

139
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,160
Well, they're not idiots, either,

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,680
so before they would approve
me as the executioner,

141
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,850
HQ made me forge a pact to kill you.

142
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,620
So I did have to kill you for a second.

143
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,990
I'm real sorry about that.

144
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,270
Wait, then how am I alive?

145
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,960
The reverse cursed technique.

146
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,610
I used my reverse cursed technique

147
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,360
the moment your heart stopped
to immediately heal you.

148
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,800
I figured it would work,
given what I heard about you before.

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,060
There are few people who know I'm
capable of outputting positive energy.

150
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,620
That's right.

151
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,230
This is the second time
you've faked your death.

152
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,290
They'll probably figure it out soon,
but the situation's still chaotic.

153
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,520
They should consider

154
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,480
your death sentence carried out for a while.

155
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,630
Why would you go that far?

156
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,910
Because the people I cherish...

157
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,580
cherish you.

158
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,930
I once shouldered

159
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,770
a power greater than I could bear.

160
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,160
Though the power I thought
was forced upon me

161
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,660
turned out to be something
I brought upon myself.

162
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,970
I'm not like you.

163
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,180
The power you shoulder isn't your own power.

164
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,180
You're not to blame.

165
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,270
You're wrong.

166
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,190
It's not even a matter of blame.

167
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,190
I killed...

168
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,400
Itadori!

169
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,670
Fushiguro.

170
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
We're going back to Jujutsu High!

172
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,880
The barrier around Jujutsu
High is weakened now.

173
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,050
It's fine for you to return

174
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,940
as long as no one sees your face directly.

175
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,040
We'll meet up with the upperclassmen, then—

176
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,040
Stop it!

177
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,840
Don't accept what happened like it's normal.

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
Don't negate what happened!

179
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,600
I killed people.

180
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,060
Because of me, so many people died!

181
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,060
Because of us.

182
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,310
Of course you'd say that.

183
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,490
Don't go giving up by yourself.

184
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,710
We aren't heroes.

185
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,770
We're jujutsu sorcerers.

186
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,340
There's no one who can
judge us in a true sense.

187
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,590
That's all the more reason

188
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,100
we have to keep proving why we exist.

189
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,000
You're wrong, Fushiguro.

190
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,340
We don't have time to worry
about ourselves anymore!

191
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,970
If you say that, you'll...

192
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,220
We have to keep saving people!

193
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,720
...end up suffering...

194
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,480
I thought this was supposed to
be your driving motive, anyway!

195
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,010
...the whole time you remain with me!

196
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,230
So start by saving me,

197
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,440
Itadori!

198
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,990
Huh?

199
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,570
Noritoshi Kamo has set up

200
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,590
a death game between those
he granted cursed techniques.

201
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,460
The Culling Game.

202
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,750
Tsumiki has been drawn into this game, too.

203
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,340
Please, Itadori.

204
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,300
I need your power.

205
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,560
The Culling Game
1) After awakening their cursed technique,
players must go to a colony of their choice within 19 days
and pledge their participation in the culling game.
2) Players breaching the first rule shall be stripped of their technique.
3) Non-players shall become players upon entering a colony,
and their entry shall be taken as pledging to participate in the culling game.
4) Players will receive points upon ending the life of another player.
5) Points shall be designated based on the value that the game master gives their life,
and fundamentally a sorcerer will be worth 5 points
while non-sorcerers will be worth 1 point.
6) By spending 100 points,
not counting the initial point value assigned to them, players may negotiate
with the game master to add an additional rule to the culling game.
7) The game master must approve any additional rules
requested under Rule 6 above, except when the Rule
would significantly hinder the continuation of the culling game.
8) Players who do not show a change in points
within 19 days of joining or acquiring points
shall be stripped of their technique.

206
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,980
The Culling Game

207
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,360
General Rules

208
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:23,940
Within 19 Days

209
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,310
Participate

210
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,570
Breach

211
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,940
Technique

212
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,230
Stripped

213
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,360
Entering a Colony

214
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,690
Participate

215
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,320
Ending

216
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,570

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,110

220
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,000
JUJUTSU KAISEN

221
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,760
Please, Itadori.

222
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,350
I need your power.

223
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,600
Okkotsu-senpai.

224
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,790
Sukuna is plotting something
that uses Fushiguro.

225
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,850
He was probably able to take
over my body in Shibuya

226
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,290
because I was force-fed ten fingers at once.

227
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,260
There are now 15 fingers inside me.

228
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,890
Even if I'm fed the remaining
five all at once,

229
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,010
I don't think he'll be able to take me over.

230
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,270
But even so,

231
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,360
if Sukuna does manage to take control again,

232
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,840
don't hesitate to kill me.

233
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,430
I trust you can do that, Senpai.

234
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,310
All right.

235
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,040
I'll do my best.

236
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,970
Fushiguro.

237
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,900
What do I need to do?

238
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,790
First, we return to Jujutsu High

239
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,000
and contact Tengen-sama.

240
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,930
How can we release the
seal of the Prison Realm?

241
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,240
What is Noritoshi Kamo's actual goal,

242
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
and what moves will he make?

243
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,960
The culling game is an unprecedented
act of jujutsu terrorism,

244
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,550
and we need answers to those two
questions to resolve the situation.

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,430
I think Tengen-sama's the only
one capable of answering them.

246
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,390
What about that woman?

247
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,300
Wouldn't Tsukumo-san know?

248
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,110
I've already spoken with Tsukumo-san.

249
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,820
This was her plan.

250
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,350
She's also hiding away at Jujutsu High.

251
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,040
Hiding away?

252
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,650
Apparently, she doesn't want
to deal with the higher-ups.

253
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,100
The problem is Tengen-sama's
concealment barriers.

254
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,680
Out of 1,000 constantly shuffling doors,

255
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,990
only one leads to the Tombs of the Star
where Tengen-sama resides.

256
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,920
So unless we can pick the right door,

257
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,170
we can't meet with Tengen-sama?

258
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm sorry, Fushiguro.

259
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,830
I'm going to ask now anyway.

260
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,690
What happened to Kugisaki?

261
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,990
I see.

262
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,530
All right.

263
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,080
All right!

264
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,650
We might be able to do something

265
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,180
about the concealment barriers.

266
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,100
You were listening?

267
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,310
What do you mean, Choso?

268
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,850
You remember when Mahito stole

269
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,020
Sukuna's fingers and us
Death Paintings, right?

270
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
We'll do the same thing.

271
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,140
It's been... not that long, really.

272
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,700
Maki-senpai?!

273
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, hello.

274
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
Maki-san!

275
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,810
Is safe for you to be up and moving already?

276
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,750
Yeah, it's not an issue.

277
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,260
Not much I could do about the burns.

278
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,950
Scars remain, even with the
reverse cursed technique.

279
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,720
Though your Heavenly Pact of
physical prowess is impressive.

280
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,970
At the very end, your life was saved by
the strength of your body's endurance

281
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,130
rather than your resistance to curses.

282
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,600
It's a shame the clan head didn't make it.

283
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,190
It's not like it was a competition.

284
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,680
Megumi, how goes it with
Tengen-sama's barrier?

285
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,560
Well...

286
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,250
I'll explain.

287
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,340
On the way to the Tombs of the Star

288
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,420
is the forbidden vault holding Jujutsu High's
cursed tools and cursed objects, right?

289
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,020
The remains of my brothers—

290
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,150
Noranso, Sho-oso, Tanso,
Sanso, Kotsuso, and Shoso—

291
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,410
are in the forbidden vault.

292
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,770
Even if it's just their remains,
with all six together,

293
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,900
I should be able to sense their presence

294
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,180
using the side effect of my technique.

295
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,030
Good!

296
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,530
That's great to hear,

297
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,680
but who's this?

298
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,730
For now, you can say...

299
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,500
he's my older brother.

300
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,020
Yuji!

301
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,310
Let's go.

302
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,440
That one.

303
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,910
I'm certain.

304
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,600
My younger brothers are resting beyond here.

305
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,560
I'm opening it.

306
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,410
Yeah.

307
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,660
Let's head down.

308
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,540
There's an elevator leading to
the Tombs of the Star further in.

309
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,290
Choso.

310
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,060
I know.

311
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,910
I'll come back for you later.

312
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,960
Please wait a little longer.

313
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,010
Blood stains?

314
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,730
Did something happen?

315
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,220
It was twelve years ago.

316
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,720
Thinking back,

317
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,620
all of the distortions may
have started back then.

318
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,640
All right, everyone,
the main hall is up ahead.

319
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,490
There's nothing here.

320
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,280
This is the main hall?

321
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,480
No, he's rejecting us.

322
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,800
Tengen won't interfere with reality, but...

323
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,700
I thought it would be
possible to reach him now,

324
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,640
while the Six Eyes are sealed away,

325
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,450
but my prediction was naïve.

326
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,210
It's not all of us being
rejected... but just me?

327
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,450
Let's head back.

328
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,350
Tsumiki-san doesn't have time to spare.

329
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,750
You're leaving?

330
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,430
Nice to meet you.

331
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,820
Child of Zen'in, Descendant of Michizane,

332
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,110
Cursed Womb Death Painting,

333
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,880
and Vessel of Sukuna.

334
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,700
I must impose one condition.

335
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,990
We came here to learn how
to open the Prison Realm.

336
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,470
No greeting for me?

337
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,120
Then why is this Culling Game...

338
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,650
...to force the evolution of mankind...

339
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,660
...it's better for the rules if being
stripped means death, too.

340
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,550
If Sukuna does take control again,
don't hesitate to kill me.

341
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,060
Next Episode
About the Culling Game

342
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,340
Don't die out there.
