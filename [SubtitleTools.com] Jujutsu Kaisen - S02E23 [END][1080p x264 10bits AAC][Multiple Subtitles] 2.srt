1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,050
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

2
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,010
Do you remember

3
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,710
the ways to rid cursed
spirits from our world?

4
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,200
Regardless of which method is pursued,

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,120
it means advancing humanity
to the next stage.

6
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,760
Now, I need to buy time for Larue to act.

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,930
Humanity's next stage is

8
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,150
freeing itself from cursed energy.

9
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,120
No. It's optimizing cursed energy.

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,410
Uh, I don't get it, either.

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,920
I thought you already gave on your plan
twelve years ago, when Zen'in Toji died.

12
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I was talking to Geto-kun, you know.

13
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,670
Well, whatever.

14
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,660
I went back to my original idea.

15
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,290
Besides, there's a big hole
in your optimization plan.

16
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,310
Extremely few sorcerers and cursed spirits
emerge in other countries compared to Japan.

17
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,430
So Tengen's barriers should be
indispensable to your optimization plan.

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,470
Using Tengen to optimize
cursed energy would mean

19
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,920
only the humans of this nation
would become sorcerers.

20
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,330
Japan would practically have
a monopoly on cursed energy.

21
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,000
Other nations, especially that superpower,
wouldn't stand by and allow that.

22
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,760
Flesh-and-blood humans
would become an energy source.

23
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,010
It's easy enough to imagine
what misfortune that would bring.

24
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,520
That's a world far removed
from the ideals I pursue.

25
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,140
So what?

26
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,400
For one thing, our objectives are different.

27
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,160
I don't desire a world
without cursed spirits

28
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,160
or any sort of idyllic peace.

29
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,800
Non-sorcerers, sorcerers, cursed spirits...

30
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,660
Those are all possibilities

31
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,540
for the shape of cursed
energy that is mankind.

32
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,390
Though that shouldn't be
anywhere near the full extent.

33
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,170
I tried to give rise

34
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,940
to other possibilities
for mankind on my own.

35
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,540
But that didn't work out.

36
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,420
Everything that I created myself

37
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,340
was limited by the bounds
of my own potential.

38
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,110
The answer was always
glimmering darkly within chaos.

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Do you understand?

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,300
What I should have created

41
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,410
was chaos that went
beyond my own control.

42
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,410
I've already finished
extracting the technique.

43
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,680
There was a cursed spirit
called Mahito, right?!

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,260
The one with the technique
that let it interfere with souls!

45
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,050
That guy absorbed it earlier.

46
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,340
Seriously?!

47
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,850
Idle Transfiguration.

48
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,710
Tengen's barrier? No, this is...

49
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,330
Remote activation of a cursed technique?!

50
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,920
You have my thanks, Yuji Itadori.

51
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,420
A cursed spirit's mastery of
their technique ceases to progress

52
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,800
from the moment they're absorbed
by Cursed Spirit Manipulation.

53
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Mahito truly matured
through his fight with you.

54
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,760
To be honest, I wanted to have
Jogo, as well, but no matter.

55
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,140
What did you do?

56
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,330
I remotely activated
Idle Transfiguration on

57
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,250
two types of non-sorcerers
that I marked ahead of time.

58
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,960
Tsumiki Fushiguro

59
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,060
One type was people whom I had absorb
cursed objects like Yuji Itadori did,

60
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,540
and the other was people like Junpei
Yoshino who have cursed techniques,

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,560
but whose brains were
structured like non-sorcerers.

62
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,320
Now I've adjusted their brains
to match those of sorcerers.

63
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,450
For the former, I gave them
the strength to be vessels,

64
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,580
and the latter have obtained the
ability to activate their techniques.

65
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,220
And now...

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,330
I've released the seal
on those cursed objects.

67
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,540
Some of them have been in a deep sleep

68
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,360
after being exposed to my
cursed energy when I marked them,

69
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
but they'll soon awaken.

70
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,660
So, starting now,

71
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll have them kill each other in order to
deepen their understanding of cursed energy.

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,630
I've carefully hand-picked
these people and cursed objects.

73
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,660
Think of it as unleashing a
thousand malevolent Yuji Itadoris.

74
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,950
A thousand?

75
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,220
That's conservative.

76
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,210
You're also underestimating
human rationality.

77
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,350
Do you think people will start

78
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,960
killing each other just because
they were granted power?

79
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,840
There's an order to everything.

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,020
I certainly didn't cut corners like
that when making my preparations.

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,880
Your questions are starting
to become shallow.

82
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
He's pissing me off,
so let's all beat him up together!

83
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,950
I can't move right now, though...

84
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,610
What's the matter, Uraume?

85
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,860
I regenerated my body with
a reverse cursed technique...

86
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,260
This is...

87
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,480
Poison?!

88
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,120
My blood got mixed with
yours through Piercing Blood.

89
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
Of course it is.

90
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Wait, we're not getting cover from Mai-chan.

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,180
They might still have
more allies over there.

92
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,000
My ally is protecting Aoi,
the girl with the gun, and that suit.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,380
They don't belong here.

94
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,200
Can you move?

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,220
Yeah.

96
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,730
I can adjust my body heat.

97
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,880
No problems here.

98
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm so done.

99
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,640
We were in the middle of our talk.

100
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,080
The cursed objects that I distributed
are what's left of the sorcerers

101
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,460
I've been secretly making pacts
with for a thousand years.

102
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,960
Of course, I forged my pacts
with more than just sorcerers,

103
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,790
though my pacts with those were
annulled when I obtained this body.

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,790
You don't mean...

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,260
This is the world of the future.

106
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,470
See you later, Yuji Itadori.

107
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,150
Gojo-sensei!

108
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,160
I have high expectations for you.

109
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,480
Are you listening, Sukuna?

110
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,980
It's starting once again.

111
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,120
The world of Heian,
the golden age of jujutsu!

112
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,660
The following footage was recorded by
our crew, who happened to be on-site

113
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,280
reporting on a different matter at the
time of the incident in Tokyo the other day.

114
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,020
Please have a look.

115
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,640
Uh, it's been about ten minutes
since the blackout, I think?

116
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
It's been a while,
and the blackout continues.

117
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,320
Something really crazy is going on.

118
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,810
Sure it's not fake news?

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,460
We still cannot contact the station,
so the cause remains unknown,

120
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,360
All the news is covering this, though.

121
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,520
Hmm... Well, I'll be getting home
late today, so have a frozen dinner.

122
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,240
and we have practically
no idea what's going on.

123
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,340
Sure.

124
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,420
All 23 wards are nearly wiped out.

125
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,290
The safety of the Prime Minister's office,

126
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,540
including the Chief Cabinet
Secretary, remains uncertain.

127
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,720
It's a political void!

128
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,970
A literal hole!

129
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,300
No matter how low we estimate it,

130
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,320
we need to make a plan to evacuate
at least five million citizens.

131
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,980
Love hotels, campgrounds, ghost towns...

132
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,260
Use whatever you can, as long as it
has the bare minimum infrastructure.

133
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,770
More importantly, how are we
supposed to explain this to the residents?

134
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,580
There's no point announcing anything
when we don't know the cause!

135
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,100
Also, the government has yet
to make an announcement.

136
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,700
Was this simply the
malfunction of a substation?

137
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,160
Was it terrorism?

138
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,430
Or perhaps... it was a natural
disaster, like an earthquake?

139
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,100
Too many conspiracy theorists
are crawling out.

140
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,700
Either way, the cause remains unclear,

141
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,630
Listen, would you put your phone
away and come help me here?

142
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,530
and we're being forced to wait
while they uncover it.

143
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,530
Very well.

144
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,260
All we can firmly declare
safe are portions of

145
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,150
Okutama, Oume City, Akiruno City, Hachioji City,

146
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,220
Machida City, and various islands.

147
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,980
For now, you mean.

148
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,130
The number of cursed spirits unleashed
is no less than ten million.

149
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,550
You want to enact an evacuation order
on every ward of the entire city?

150
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,980
Afterward, we declare
the wards forbidden to entry.

151
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,820
Make it a real uninhabited zone.

152
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,600
More importantly,
what about our announcement?

153
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,840
Who's making it?

154
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,800
Less "who" and more "how" to make it.

155
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,830
We still can't get a hold
of the deputy secretary?

156
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,420
No, we can't.

157
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,840
I haven't heard anything
from his secretary, either.

158
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,250
What should we do?

159
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,700
Now, now, the upper brass
will figure that out.

160
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,530
For now, we need to establish
contact with each ministry.

161
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,540
The low yen ain't stopping.

162
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,870
That was at least good for exports, right?

163
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,940
The Japanese Business
Federation has lost it?

164
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,860
They won't be doing any
lobbying if everyone's dead.

165
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,360
Move the Prime Minister to Osaka!

166
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,360
At this rate, there'll be a massive
outbreak of cursed spirits everywhere!

167
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,150
Most jujutsu sorcerers are already assigned
to protecting evacuees in the city!

168
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,540
And that outbreak is coming now!

169
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,500
With a power vacuum of this scale,

170
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,380
we may see military intervention
from other nations.

171
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,160
Yes. Huh?

172
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,380
Oh, no.

173
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,260
Yes.

174
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,380
I understand.

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,450
They're going to publicly announce
the existence of cursed spirits.

176
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,460
Huh?!

177
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,720
They're going public with cursed spirits?!

178
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,060
Are they seriously suggesting that?!

179
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,270
Apparently, they intend to announce
that cursed spirits only arise in Tokyo.

180
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,230
So the goal is to direct the populace's
leaking cursed energy to Tokyo

181
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,400
and limit the outbreak of
cursed spirits to there, huh?

182
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,820
This is why I recommended Itami as a potential
relocation site after Kansai Airport was built!

183
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,100
Maybe it's better this way?

184
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,800
They wouldn't have reached this decision
if Kasumigaseki was functioning.

185
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,570
Um, once again, we're sharing the latest.

186
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,460
The blackout still continues as before,

187
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,330
and we're unable to contact anyone.

188
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,610
There's been no official announcement, either,
so the cause remains unknown.

189
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,840
The question is, how long will this last—hmm?

190
00:13:48,610 --> 00:14:04,360
LIVE               Unusual Phenomenon in the Capital? Damage Is Spreading

191
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,550
What?  What is that?!

192
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,940
Hey!

193
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,110
Please wait a moment

194
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,830
Please wait a moment

195
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,310
Huh? What is this?

196
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,880
A movie?

197
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,160
The barrier centered around the Imperial
Palace that was erected in the Meiji era,

198
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,810
and the barrier centered directly
above the Tombs of the Star Corridor,

199
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,510
which was a proposed site for the
relocation of Tokyo in the Bakumatsu era,

200
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,690
will be forcibly expanded out
to the borders of the prefecture.

201
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,910
Come.

202
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,650
Come.

203
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,760
It's dangerous here.

204
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,150
I have a warm bath.

205
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,580
I can sing songs, too.

206
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,400
What about my mom?

207
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,420
Your mother, father,

208
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,830
older sister, younger brother,
and teacher are all here.

209
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,070
I don't have a younger brother.

210
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,050
And I hate my teacher.

211
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,990
I don't have a younger brother.

212
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,470
And I hate my teacher.

213
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,200
Are you okay?

214
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,450
Need a drink?

215
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Please?

216
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,070
Sorry.

217
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Did I scare you?

218
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,070
Are you hurt?

219
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,020
Were you with anyone?

220
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,720
Like your mom or dad?

221
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,360
I don't know.

222
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,780
It's all commercial buildings here,

223
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,670
so I guess she's not from around here?

224
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,860
Did you walk a lot?

225
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,110
I see. You worked hard.

226
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,860
You can see them, huh?

227
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,220
That's bad, Rika-chan.

228
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't overdo it.

229
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,100
I'm sorry. I hesitated.

230
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,600
I thought I should sit back and watch,

231
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,750
and give him room to work, since the
situation had already progressed so far.

232
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,420
Have you realized yet?

233
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm not really on your side.

234
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm just a humble beauty who wants to
eradicate cursed spirits from the world.

235
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,870
It might not be much of an apology,

236
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,480
but my allies and I will take responsibility
for delivering the kids who were there.

237
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,770
It's high time I confronted Tengen, too.

238
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,320
What will you do?

239
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,450
Good work, Okkotsu.

240
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,640
You don't really intend to thank me,

241
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,560
so let's just get to the point.

242
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,220
Now you understand that
I'll obey your orders, right?

243
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,520
No amount of killing cursed
spirits will prove anything.

244
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,620
Then forge a pact or whatever you need to.

245
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,020
It doesn't matter that he's
one of Gojo-sensei's students.

246
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,670
He cut off Inumaki-kun's arms in Shibuya.

247
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,360
So I will kill Yuji Itadori.

248
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,910

Shibuya Incident - Gate, Close
